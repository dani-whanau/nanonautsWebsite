    <h1>Choosing an Instrument</h1>
    <p class="need-help">If you need help choosing an instrument send us an email</p>
    <p>Playing a concert can be great fun! Or can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time</p>
    <p>So we've put together a list of top tips or great concerts!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <h2>Copy out a set-list</h2>
    <p>A <strong>set-list</strong>is a list of all your songs and the order you will play them</p>
    <p>Make copies for everyone!</p>
    <p>Print it <strong>BIG!</strong>so that you can still read it if it's shown down by your feet on the floor or if
        the lighting isn't good.</p>
    <h2>Remember your spares</h2>
    <p>Some instruments have spare parts that need to be replaced if they wear out or break. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>guitar strings</li>
        <li>saxophone or clarinet reeds</li>
        <li>drumsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make a list of the spares you may need and make sure you know where they are in an emergency</p>
    <h2>Plan where you'll be on stage</h2>
    <p>Before you start to set up your instruments on stage, take a few minutes to decide where you'll all be going to
        be.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will the drums be center stage?</li>
        <li>Is there a power socket somewhere?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you star setting up your instruments</p>
    <h2>No where you are going</h2>
    <p>If you are playing a concert somewhere you have never been before make sure you know where it is.</p>
    <p>And when you do arrive the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on</strong>. Don't be
        caught out!</p>
